    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    Startify is a free, open source website which allows you to plan a business/startup. It uses the idea of "spitting" your ideas onto the page to get everything out, and then carefully planning and re-wording the things you've stated in a short period of time.
    <br><br>

    <h3>How can I use this?</h3>
    Simply click the button below:
    <br><br>
    <a href="plan.html" class="w3-button w3-round w3-blue w3-center">Plan Now</a>
    <br><br>

    <h3>What is in the source code and where can I find it?</h3>
    The source code contains HTML and Javascript and uses the W3.CSS framework for styling. It also contains a few CSS lines to set the font to Source Sans Pro - Bold. The Javascript is used for creating, getting and removing localStorage items to show your ideas. The source code can be located using the link below:
